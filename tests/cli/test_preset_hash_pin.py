"""Pin: the YAML-surface rename must not move any bundled preset's hash.

``preset_hash`` is stamped into ``.osprey-manifest.json`` at build time and
compared by the deploy-side staleness advisory, so a hash that moves for a
purely cosmetic key rename would report drift on every already-deployed
project. The digests below were recorded from the bundled presets *before* the
``data_bundle`` → ``app_template`` YAML rename; they are the durable evidence
that the rename stayed hash-neutral, and they are deliberately hardcoded rather
than recomputed — a test that derives its expectation from the code under test
would pin nothing.

Any change to these values means a preset's *resolved content* changed. That is
a legitimate thing to do, but it is a deploy-visible event: update the digest
here in the same commit, knowingly.

    # A digest here is the resolved content of the preset AND of every preset
    # that extends it, so a change in the base moves every control-assistant
    # entry with it. Last moved when the bluesky-web sidecar shed its
    # panels-era name, a deploy-visible change (the panel's backing service
    # and its config keys are renamed). Comment rewrites cannot move a digest
    # (`_hash_resolved_profile` hashes resolved canonical JSON and says so);
    # only a key or value change can. Some such changes are behavior-neutral
    # and some are not — a rebuilt project can gain or lose a tab, a hook, a
    # health check or a skill directory — and in either case the deploy-side
    # staleness advisory firing on already-deployed projects is the correct
    # signal, not noise.
    # Moved when the control-assistant preset turned password login on for its
    # web terminals (auth stanza, ariel's `login: false`, demo passwords under
    # `env.defaults`). Every control-assistant entry moved together, as the
    # note above predicts.
    # Moved again when pymongo became a core OSPREY dependency and the preset
    # dropped its `dependencies: [pymongo>=4.0]` line. Behavior-neutral for a
    # rebuilt project — pymongo still lands in its venv, now from the base
    # install rather than the profile — but the generated pyproject.toml no
    # longer names it, so the advisory firing is correct.
    # Moved twice in one release window. The control-assistant tier gained the
    # `bluesky-plans` skill, so a rebuilt project grows a
    # `.claude/skills/bluesky-plans/` directory; and it gained
    # `landing.notices` and `landing.footer`, so its landing page grows a
    # collapsible "working safely" section and a footer line. Both are
    # deploy-visible, so the staleness advisory firing on already-deployed
    # projects is correct. `control-assistant-ariel` excludes the skill by
    # name, so only the notices moved its digest.
    #
    # Moved again — and the family grew a fifth member — when the base gained
    # its TIER FLOOR and the admin tier shipped. Two deploy-visible deltas,
    # both landing on the base and therefore on all four presets that extend
    # it:
    #
    #   * The floor itself. The base now denies
    #     `mcp__osprey_workspace__setup_patch` and pins
    #     `web.config_panel.enabled: false` and
    #     `web.scaffold_gallery.write_enabled: false`, so a rebuilt project's
    #     settings.json grows a deny entry and its config.yml flips two keys
    #     from the app template's permissive defaults to false:
    #     the agent loses its deployment-editing tool and the browser loses the
    #     Config panel and the gallery's editors.
    #   * The roster. A third login (`carol`, persona `admin`) and its
    #     `OSPREY_AUTH_PW_CAROL` default join the base's web-terminals block,
    #     alongside the `admin` persona catalog entry — so a rebuilt hosting
    #     project grows a landing card, a terminal container and a per-user
    #     port in every family.
    #
    # `control-assistant-admin` is the new entry, not a moved one: it is the
    # single tier that lifts the floor back off (`remove_deny` for the tool,
    # both web keys back to true) and adds the `setup-mode` skill.
