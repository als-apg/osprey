What is Osprey Framework?
--------------------------

The **Osprey Framework** provides a production-ready architecture for building domain-specific agentic systems. Built on :doc:`LangGraph's StateGraph foundation <developer-guides/01_understanding-the-framework/03_langgraph-integration>`, it implements a structured pipeline that transforms natural language inputs into reliable, orchestrated execution plans.

The framework addresses common challenges in agentic system development: :doc:`tool management at scale <developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/03_classification-and-routing>`, :doc:`structured orchestration without hallucination <developer-guides/01_understanding-the-framework/04_orchestrator-first-philosophy>`, and seamless integration of :doc:`human oversight workflows <api_reference/03_production_systems/01_human-approval>`.

Core Architecture
------------------

Our framework provides a domain-agnostic architecture for safety-critical systems, turning natural-language requests into reliable action through a four-stage pipeline—Task Extraction, Classification, Orchestration, and Execution with checkpointing and artifact tracking:

1. :doc:`Task Extraction <developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/02_task-extraction-system>` → Convert conversational context into structured, actionable objectives

2. :doc:`Classification <developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/03_classification-and-routing>` → Dynamically select relevant capabilities from your domain-specific toolkit

3. :doc:`Orchestration <developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/04_orchestrator-planning>` → Generate complete execution plans with explicit dependencies and human oversight

4. **Execution** → Execute capabilities with checkpointing, artifact management, and safety controls

   **Production Deployment Example**: This diagram illustrates the framework architecture using capabilities from the :doc:`ALS Accelerator Assistant <example-applications/als-assistant>` - our production deployment at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Advanced Light Source particle accelerator.

The framework provides:

* **Capability-Based Architecture**: :doc:`Modular agent construction <developer-guides/02_quick-start-patterns/01_building-your-first-capability>` with selective capability activation based on task requirements
* **Orchestrator-First Design**: :doc:`Complete execution planning <developer-guides/04_infrastructure-components/04_orchestrator-planning>` prior to capability invocation, eliminating iterative tool-calling patterns
* **Secure Python Execution**: :doc:`Containerized code generation and execution <developer-guides/05_production-systems/03_python-execution-service>` with static analysis, human approval, and flexible deployment environments
* **Registry-Based Discovery**: :doc:`Convention-driven component loading <developer-guides/01_understanding-the-framework/02_convention-over-configuration>` enables seamless integration of capabilities, data sources, and services across applications
* **Control System Abstraction**: :doc:`Pluggable connectors for control systems <developer-guides/05_production-systems/06_control-system-integration>` (EPICS, LabVIEW, Tango, Mock) enable development without hardware and seamless migration to production through configuration
* **External Data Integration**: :doc:`Automatic retrieval from databases and knowledge bases <developer-guides/05_production-systems/02_data-source-integration>` during task understanding and capability execution for data-driven responses
* **LangGraph Integration**: Native StateGraph workflows with :doc:`checkpoints, interrupts <developer-guides/01_understanding-the-framework/03_langgraph-integration>`, and :doc:`persistent state management <developer-guides/03_core-framework-systems/01_state-management-architecture>`
* **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**: :ref:`Transparent execution plans <planning-mode-example>` with :doc:`approval workflows <developer-guides/05_production-systems/01_human-approval-workflows>` for high-stakes operational environments
* **Domain Abstraction**: Framework patterns applicable across diverse infrastructure, from :doc:`simple agents <getting-started/hello-world-tutorial>` to complex :doc:`production control systems <getting-started/control-assistant>`
