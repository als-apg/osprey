/**
 * Micro-frontend query-param contract for the design-system front-end.
 *
 * Documents and applies the WELL-KNOWN query params a host page may pass to
 * an embedded design-system frame:
 *
 * - `embedded` — `"true"` marks the page as running inside a host frame; see
 *   {@link applyEmbedded}, which adds the `embedded` class to `document.body`
 *   when set.
 * - `theme` — owned and read pre-paint by theme-boot.js / theme-manager.js.
 *   It is deliberately NOT read here: theme-boot.js is a non-module inline
 *   script that resolves and applies `data-theme` before first paint, so
 *   re-reading `theme` in this (deferred) ES module would just duplicate that
 *   read after the fact and risks a visible theme flash. Consult
 *   theme-boot.js / theme-manager.js for the theme contract.
 *
 * `CONTRACT_VERSION` identifies the version of this query-param contract so
 * host pages and embedded frames can detect a mismatch.
 *
 * Note (decision OC-1): a generic `frameParam()` / `frameParams()` getter is
 * intentionally NOT provided here — that surface is deferred until a second
 * consumer actually needs it.
