"""The Bluesky bridge's FastAPI app: wires the run registry, promote gate, and
scanner seam (``runs.py``, ``security.py``, ``scanner.py``) into HTTP routes.

Two processes, one machine (see PLAN.md's Technical Architecture): this app
runs in a separate container from OSPREY's own venv, reachable only over
HTTP plus the ``X-Promote-Token`` header. It stays import-clean of bluesky/
ophyd/tiled in Phase 1 — ``_scanner_factory`` defaults to the no-op
``FakeScanner`` so this app is runnable and manually smoke-testable
(``GET /health``, even a real ``promote``) before the bluesky-backed
``Scanner`` exists. Real wiring swaps the factory via ``set_scanner_factory``:
either a facility's own deploy code, or this module's own opt-in
``_lifespan`` hook — real EPICS devices (``BLUESKY_EPICS_SUBSTRATE``) or the
built-in deploy smoke demo (``BLUESKY_DEMO_SCANNER``) — see below.

    is always ``buf is None`` — a present-but-empty buffer (``partial: true``,
    zero rows) is a real in-flight run and stays on the live path; checking
    "falsy rows" instead would incorrectly divert a running scan to Tiled
    before it has ever written anything there.

    Raises 409 if the registry has the run but it has no `run_uid` yet (never
    promoted, or promoted but the scan hasn't emitted a start doc) — there is
    nothing to read from either source, so Tiled is never consulted for this
    case. Raises 404 when neither source has the run — the MCP `read_scan_data`
    tool maps 404 to `unknown_run`, and a 200-empty response would make a
    nonexistent run look like a valid empty scan.
