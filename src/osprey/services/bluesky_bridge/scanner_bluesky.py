"""The real bluesky-backed ``Scanner``: a RunEngine in a daemon thread.

Implements the injected ``Scanner`` seam (``scanner.py``) that ``do_promote``
builds per promoted run. Imports bluesky, so this module lives behind the
optional ``osprey-framework[bluesky-bridge]`` extra — it must never be
imported from the lifecycle core's import path (``app.py``, ``runs.py``,
``scanner.py``, ``security.py`` stay import-clean); only a deploy wiring or a
bluesky-capable test imports this module directly.

Plan resolution happens entirely inside ``reinitialize()``: ``exec_config``
(the bridge's ``RunRequest`` — ``plan_name`` + ``plan_args``, or an equivalent
mapping) is resolved against a plan registry (by default the same built-ins +
facility-injected merge ``app.py``'s ``GET /plans`` route serves), its
``plan_args`` validated against that plan's pydantic schema, and the
resulting bluesky plan generator built and stored — all *before*
``start_scan_thread()`` ever touches a thread. That is what makes
``start_scan_thread()`` effectively all-or-nothing: the only way it can fail
is daemon-thread creation itself, not plan/device resolution (see
``runs.py``'s ``do_promote``, which also stops a partially-started scanner
defensively on any exception, as a second line of defense).

Live data: this scanner subscribes its own ``live_rows.LiveRowRecorder`` to
the RunEngine, so ``read_scan_data`` returns real buffered rows for a real
scan with no Tiled server needed. A ``TiledWriter`` subscription is optional
(best-effort — its absence, or failure to connect, never blocks a scan).

``error_message`` is the Scanner protocol's explicit terminal-error signal
(see ``scanner.py``): set on a plan-resolution failure in ``reinitialize()``
or on an uncaught exception from the RunEngine thread in ``start_scan_thread()``.
