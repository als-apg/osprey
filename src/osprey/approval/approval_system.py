"""Osprey Approval System for Production-Ready Approval Workflows.

This module provides the core LangGraph-native approval system that integrates
with the production Gateway architecture for clean, secure approval handling.
The system enables structured interrupts for human approval of operations
requiring oversight, with comprehensive validation and error handling.

Key Components:
    - Dynamic approval type generation for flexible capability integration
    - Structured interrupt data creation for LangGraph compatibility
    - State management utilities for approval workflow handling
    - Service integration helpers for consistent interrupt propagation

The approval system supports multiple operation types including execution plans,
code execution, and memory operations, with extensible architecture for adding
new approval types without framework modifications.

Examples:
    Create approval for code execution::

        >>> interrupt_data = create_code_approval_interrupt(
        ...     code="print('Hello, World!')",
        ...     analysis_details={'safety_level': 'low'},
        ...     execution_mode='readonly',
        ...     safety_concerns=[]
        ... )
        >>> # Use interrupt_data with LangGraph interrupt() function

    Handle approval resume::

        >>> has_resume, payload = get_approval_resume_data(state, "python_executor")
        >>> if has_resume and payload:
        ...     code = payload['code']
        ...     # Execute approved code

.. note::
   This module is designed for security-critical operations. All approval
   functions include comprehensive validation and error handling.

    Provides standardized handling for service calls that may generate
